## About project
A simple landing page built with _HTML, CSS and JavaScript_. This website project was made to consolidate my knowledge and skills after I finished a advanced web developer course about CSS. It's my first time when I built responsive website. I made use of **Flexbox, Media queries and Preprocessor Sass.**
