> A simple landing page built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website project was made to consolidate my knowledge and skills after I finished a advanced web developer course about CSS. It's my first time when I built responsive website. I made use of **Flexbox, Media queries and Preprocessor Sass.**

## General Information
- The website is built using technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main theme is culinary workshops. I used Flexbox technology, media queries and added several animations both in CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, it has a shopping cart section.
- This site does not scale well on larger monitors. I only tested it on a laptop and using Chrome developer mode. I suspect that there may be some empty spaces, which will not be aesthetic, but otherwise the elements will arrange correctly.
- The project was created to consolidate knowledge from the course, which presented advanced practices in creating responsive websites. In addition to the technologies that make a website responsive, this course also included information on creating animations.
Over time, I learned the programming language JavaScript and programmed some of the animations. I also added a shopping cart and the ability to add products to it. Unfortunately, the shopping cart becomes empty after refreshing the page. In the future, I would like the site to store this data in LocalStorage. Additionally, I would also like to add an administrator panel so that the person managing the website can add new course offers and recipes. I also have an idea to add the ability to switch to the english version.
- The main goal and problem was to learn how to make websites responsive. My other projects mainly focus on the programming part. Even though I used CSS in them, I omitted the part about responsiveness. In addition to the above technologies, I also used the **clamp function** for all texts, which makes the fonts scale depending on the browser width.
